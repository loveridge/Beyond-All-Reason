# Translation workflow is:
# 1. English I18N keys/captions changed on master
# 2. master merged to transifex-synchronization-source
# 3. Transifex picks up changes on transifex-synchronization-source
# 4. Translations made on Transifex
# 5. Transifex creates pull request against transifex-synchronization-source

# Since transifex-synchronization-source is just a staging branch to
# control updates to Transifex, it is never merged to master, so we
# need to change the merge target of Transifex's pull requests to master
